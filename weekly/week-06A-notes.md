## II. Review Web Components

- [WC-1 - Intro to Web Components](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-wc-1.md):
  - we learned about Custom Elements, the Shadow DOM and HTML templates
  - we saw how to extend the `HTMLElement` class, what needs to go into the `contructor()` and the `connectedCallback` lifecycle method
- [WC-2 - more lifecycle methods](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-wc-2.md):
  - we discussed the naming rules for custom element and custom attribute names, how to change custom element attribute values via JavaScript
  - we also implemented `static get observedAttributes()` & the `attributeChangedCallback()` and `disconnectedCallback()` lifecycle methods
  - we also saw how to add JavaScript to our components - in this case a "count" that increased every time the text was clicked 
- [WC-3 - Build a component driven web app](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-wc-3.md):
  - in this exercise we converted a Star Wars Character app to use web components - here `<sw-header>`, `<sw-footer>` and `<sw-card>`
  - we were exposed to `??` - JavaScript's new *nullish coalescing operator*
- [WC-4 - Walk through a `<my-list>` web component](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-wc-4.md)
