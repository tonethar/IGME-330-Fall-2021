# Week 5A - Finish up (mostly) Web Components

## I. Review
- **[Project 1 - VanillaJS App of Awesomeness](../projects/project-1.md)**:
  - Executive summary: - `fetch()` with error handling, 1 web service or more, 3 web components or more, 4 pages, navigation system, local storage, Bulma, mobile friendly, ES6 modules, and follow the [IGME-330 JS style guide](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Fall-2021/blob/main/projects/code-style.md)
  - Checkpoints/Deliverables (see myCourses for exact due dates & times):
    - Friday 09/24 (end of week 5) - Idea posted to myCourses discussion thread
    - Friday 10/01 (end of week 6) - Working Prototype due (Bulma not required) 
    - Friday 10/08 (end of week 7) - Final Version 
- **Looking ahead to Project 2 - which is *Improved VanillaJS App of Awesomeness*** :
  - we will be "rolling" right into Project 2 as we are completing Project 1, so be sure to get Project 1 done on time
  - Firebase (store data in cloud) and MapBox will be covered in class. To take advantage of MapBox and increase , you might want to pick a web service that has location data in it
  - The use of Firebase is required in Project 2
  - Project 2 will be due Friday 10/22 (end of week 9)
- **4B Breakout Activity - Counters of Awesomeness**:
  - we did this last time, the instructions are in myCourses

## II. Lecture/HW Notes
- [Web Components-4 - Walk through a `<my-list>` web component](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-wc-4.md):
  - this is pretty straightforward, and there isn't a HW assignment associated with it, so we will cover it first
- [HW - Web Components-3 - Build a component driven web app](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-wc-3.md):
  - the code is a little more elaborate, and there's a HW  assignment
<!-- - Web Components-5: web components and custom events -->

## III. Demo - nested web components
- Can you put Web Components *inside* of other Web Components?
  - You betcha!
  - This is common in the 3rd party frameworks - for example the template code generated by `create-react-app` comes with an `App` component that contains all othe other components the template needs
  - Demo `<sw-app>`:
    - we get rid of **main.js**, and move all if the app functionality into `<sw-app>`
    - we also move the ajax code to **utils.js**:
      - we need to **`export`** `loadFile()` from **utils.js**
      - we need to **`import`** `loadFile()` into **sw-app.js** 
    - got rid of global variables and functions like `swcJSON`, and instead made everything a property of `SWApp`
    - another tricky thing is the ajax callback code - because of `this` issues we needed to use [`function.bind()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_objects/Function/bind)

**sw-web-app.html**
```html
<body>
  <sw-app></sw-app>
</body>
```

**sw-app.js**
```js
import "./sw-header.js";
import "./sw-card.js";
import "./sw-footer.js";
import {loadFile} from "./utils.js";

const template = document.createElement("template");
template.innerHTML = `
<style>
...
</style>
<sw-header data-title="Star Wars Character Finder"></sw-header>
<main>
  <select id="character-select"></select>
  <hr>
  <div class="card-list"></div>
</main>
<sw-footer data-title="Ace Coder" data-year="2021"></sw-footer>
`;

class SWApp extends HTMLElement{
  constructor(){
    super();
    ...
}
```

**main.js** looks like this:

```js
import "./sw-app.js";
```
