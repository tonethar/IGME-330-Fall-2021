# Week 3B - Finish up Ajax (`async` + `await`) & Web Components

<!--
## I. Review

1. Let's review transformations! Grab the start files for [Demo B](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/canvas-3.md#demo-B) - **screen-saver-2-start.html** - the one from last time that we didn't do

    - you can follow along with the demo, or not, either way we'll post the done versions to myCourses
    - below is some helpful code that demonstrates [`window.setInterval()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setInterval)
    
```js
setInterval(function(){ctx.clearRect(0,0,640,480);},20000); // "clear screen" every 20 seconds
setInterval(fillBGWithRandomTint,5000); // call `fillBGWithRandomTint()` every 5 seconds
```

2. Don't forget about the upcoming HW assignments - see myCourses dropbox - they are listed here - [week-03A-notes.md#hw](week-03A-notes.md#hw)

    - Reminder: you **MUST** complete at least **ONE** of the 3 extra credit assignments

## II. More Canvas

1. [Canvas V - Drawing images & Blending Modes](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/canvas-5.md)

<hr>

## III. Some computational beauty

1. [HW - Sine Wave](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-sine-wave.md) - Here we are going to explore common periodic functions by building both a static sine wave, and an animated one, and maybe give you some ideas for Project 1. Be sure to follow along!

2. Phyllotaxis - [HW - Algorithmic Botany](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-algorithmic-botany.md)

<!--
- [Project 1](../projects/project-1.md) questions?
- Review [HW - Lorenz Attractor](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-lorenz-attractor.md)
- Any questions about [The IIFE - "Immediately Invoked Function Expression"](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/IIFE-notes.md) ?
- Let's get you to do some [IIFE-review.md](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/IIFE-review.md) on your own!
- Canvas transforms (translate, rotate, scale) [Canvas III - Transformations](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/canvas-3.md):
  - if we are not able to get through the entire demo during today's class, there are videos of the demo linked on the bottom of the *Canvas III* page
