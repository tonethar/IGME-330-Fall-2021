# Week 7B - Finishing up Project 1

## I. Review Project 1 Requirements
- [Project 1 Requirements](../projects/project-1.md):
  - Home/Landing/About Page
  - App Page
  - Favorites/Bookmarks Page
  - Documentation/Sources Page
  - Design & Interaction (All pages):
    - Global Navigation System with "you are here" cues
    - Pleasing graphic design (Must use Bulma, mobile friendly, embedded font)
    - Widgets are well labeled and follow interface convention
    - Users must be able to figure out how to use the app (provide instruction and tooltips if necessary)
    - User errors must be handled gracefully
    - Users must know what state the app is in at all times (hint: Bulma buttons have an `is-loading` class)
  - Rubric
  - Demo Video
