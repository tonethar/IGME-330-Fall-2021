# Week 2B - Review of TB-3 and XHR

## I. Review the HW
- [Technobabble III](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-technobabble-3.md)
  - Media queries (CSS `display` property)
  - Creating one function that will be called by both buttons (need to pass parameters from an event handler)
- Ajax HW
  - [HW - Ajax-1 - loading and parsing text files](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-ajax-1.md)
    - When would you ever load unstructured text?
      - Most commonly, as HTML fragments
    - Let's look at the "HTML creation" code - both the "long way" and the "one-liner"
  - [HW - Ajax-2 - loading and parsing CSV files](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-ajax-2.md)
    - When would you ever use a CSV file?
      - when working with large amounts of data, it is very common to export it from a spreadsheet and save it as CSV
      - when the data set is large, keeping data locally as CSV can be much more efficient than hitting up (for example) a web service repeatedly
    - look at array [destructuring assignment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment)

## II. Upcoming Homework

- 


<!--
- Any questions?
  - You all just finished [Core Skills #4](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/4-adding-controls.md) (Controls: Button, checkbox, mouse clicking on the canvas):
    - another new thing was `ctx.save()` and `ctx.restore()` - and you will see how usefull these are next week when we cover canvas transformations (translate, rotate, scale)
    - Let's look at how to fix the "Play Button Spamming" issue
  - [Core Skills #5](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/5-write-some-code.md):
    - is due soon
    - mostly about adding more controls and helper functions, re-factoring the code, D.R.Y.
    - allows you to demonstrate your understanding of what we've done so far
    - don't put this off until the last minute
- Let's look at some more canvas - [canvas-2.md](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/canvas-2.md)
- Finish up *Shape Viewer*
- Preview of Next week:
  - canvas transformations, drawing gradients
  - procedurally drawing flowers - Phyllotaxis



# Week 2B - Periodic Functions & Algorithmic Botany



## I. Overview
Topics:
- Review the *SG-1* HW
- Look at how to draw Sine waves using canvas
- Get you started on Algorithmic Botany (Phyllotaxis)



## II. Presentation



- Review SG-1



- [HW - Sine Wave](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-sine-wave.md) - Here we are going to explore common periodic functions by building both a static sine wave, and an animated one, and maybe give you some ideas for Project 1. Be sure to follow along!



3. Phyllotaxis - [HW - Algorithmic Botany](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-algorithmic-botany.md)
