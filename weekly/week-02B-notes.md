# Week 2B - More Canvas

- Any questions?
  - You all just finished [Core Skills #4](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/4-adding-controls.md) (Controls: Button, checkbox, mouse clicking on the canvas):
    - another new thing was `ctx.save()` and `ctx.restore()` - and you will see how usefull these are next week when we cover canvas transformations (translate, rotate, scale)
    - Let's look at how to fix the "Play Button Spamming" issue
  - [Core Skills #5](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/5-write-some-code.md):
    - is due soon
    - mostly about adding more controls and helper functions, re-factoring the code, D.R.Y.
    - allows you to demonstrate your understanding of what we've done so far
    - don't put this off until the last minute
- Let's look at some more canvas --> [canvas-2.md](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/canvas-2.md)
- Finish up *Shape Viewer*
- Preview of Next week:
  - canvas transformations, drawing gradients
  - procedurally drawing flowers - Phyllotaxis

# Week 2B - Periodic Functions & Algorithmic Botany
<!--

<!--
## I. Overview
Topics:
- Review the *SG-1* HW
- Look at how to draw Sine waves using canvas
- Get you started on Algorithmic Botany (Phyllotaxis)
-->

<!--
## II. Presentation
-->

<!--
- Review SG-1
-->

<!--
- [HW - Sine Wave](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-sine-wave.md) - Here we are going to explore common periodic functions by building both a static sine wave, and an animated one, and maybe give you some ideas for Project 1. Be sure to follow along!

3. Phyllotaxis - [HW - Algorithmic Botany](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-algorithmic-botany.md)
