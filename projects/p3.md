## I. Overview

For this project you are creating a JavaScript driven Web application that utilizes one or more Web services.

- Your goal is to create an application that does something useful, and is easy to use, functional, and aesthetically pleasing
- The app should serve a purpose - i.e it should be useful to *someone*
- It should be (or approaching) "portfolio quality" - something you would not be embarrassed to show a potential employer
- Let's call the 3 lines above "Impact" - which is what your app should have
- Ideally the experience will run in all modern browsers, but at a bare minimum it must run in recent versions of Chrome.
- The objective of this project is for you to demonstrate your mastery of HTML5/CSS/JS "rich media" programming in a web browser context
- You will be evaluated on:
    - the quality of the experience you create
    - the soundness of your programming
    - meeting the requirements detailed below
    - how far you went beyond what we did in class, as described below

<hr>

<a id="structure"/>

## II. Structure

1) 3 distinct web pages
    - About (**home.html** or **about.html**) - a "landing" page that tells the users what the app can do
    - App  (**app.html**) - the main functionality of your app 
    - Sources (**documentation.html** or **sources.html**) - documentation of your sources and a link to your demo video

2) A **src** folder

3) A **styles** folder

4) You might also have **fonts/**, **images/** or **data/** or **src/components/** folders


<a id="content"/>

<hr>

## III. Content Requirements

<a id="page-home"/>

### III-A. Content Requirements (*Home page*)

- Tell the user what your Interactive Sandbox App does
- Have some sort of "brand" for your page:
  - it could be a `navbar-brand` like in the Bulma template - an image or font awesome icon
  - it could be a stylized logo you create yourself
- You might want to use a Bulma `hero`
- There must be at least one image on this page (in addition to whatever appears in `navbar-brand`)
- *Optional: Consider adding some sort interactive content or "flare" to this page - an image carousel, random quotes from happy users, etc*

<a id="page-documentation"/>

### III-D. Content Requirements (*Documentation page*)

- Have the following sub-headings on your page (see the [example Desktop screenshots of sources.html](#desktop-screenshots) below
  - PROJECT REQUIREMENTS:
    - provide a link to this page
  - RESOURCES UTILIZED:
    - cite any and all resources you used on this project, the specific link, including:
      - fonts and images
      - reference sites - ex. developer.mozilla.org
      - "help" sites - ex. stackoverflow.com
      - code snippet sites - ex. CodePen or gists.github.com or copying starter code from the Bulma site etc
      - tutorial sites - ex. w3schools.com
      - video sites - ex. YouTube or LinkedIn Learning or Udemy
      - blog postings etc
    - Exception: you need not cite any IGME-330 resources/tutorials/HWs:
      - but you MUST cite resources from other courses including IGME-235 
  - API:
    - Link to the API Home, documentation, and endpoints used (but don't include your API key!)
  - NOTEWORTHY:
    - Talk the project up - list the technologies you used (web components, Bulma, fetch, promises, etc)
    - Be sure to emphasize what you did outside of what we covered in class
  - GRADING
    - Describe how you met project requirements
    - Describe how you went "above and beyond" project requirements
    - In the comments field of the dropbox, grade your Project 1 submission
  - TO DO
    - List any features that you would have liked to add if you had time
    - These could potentially be added to the app for Project 2, or over break/summer when you have time

## IV. Sandbox App Functionality & User Experience (*App page*)


<hr>

### IV-A. Functional Requirements 

1. On the app page, you WILL automatically save the last term searched by the user and other UI *state* in the browser's local storage - this was covered in IGME-230/235 here --> [Web Apps 9 - WebStorage API](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-230-Master/blob/master/notes/web-apps-9.md):
    - this will also be true of the other controls on the page (&lt;select> tags, radio buttons, checkboxes etc)
    - we are going to test this capability by typing in a search term, selecting some checkboxes, doing a search, and then closing the browser window. When we re-open the window, the user's last search term must be visible, and the rest of the UI should be in the same *state*
    - ***\*THIS REQUIREMENT HAS BEEN DEFERRED TO [PROJECT 2](project-2.md)\****

2. Other required controls - there WILL be a MINIMUM of 3 controls that a user can use to affect the experience

### I-E. Design & Interaction (*All pages*)

1) Global Navigation System with "you are here" cues

2) Pleasing graphic design:
    - must use the [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) CSS framework
    - must be mobile friendly (Bulma does this by default)
    - an *embedded* font must be used - for example from https://fonts.google.com:
      - be cautious about using an ornamental or cursive embedded font for UI labels
      - instead, utilize the embedded font on ornamental elements, like a title or copyright notice
    
3) Widgets are well labeled and follow interface conventions, for example:
    - radio buttons are for mutually exclusive options, checkboxes are for when you want to let the user choose *multiple* options --> https://delib.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203430309-Radio-button-vs-checkbox-what-s-the-difference-
    
4) Users must be able to figure out how to use the app with minimal instruction:
    - be sure to provide instruction and tooltips if necessary
    
5) User errors must be handled gracefully:
    - for example, if the user forgets to type in a search term before clicking the Search button, the app should tell the user something like "Please enter a search term first"
    
6) Users must know what *state* the app is in at all times:
    - for example, when they click the search button, there should some indication that a search is happening:
      - text that says "Searching for 'Tacos' near you" and so on
      - a "spinner" or other "indeterminate progress" animation --> [Google search "indeterminate progress"](https://www.google.com/search?q=indeterminate+progress&client=safari&rls=en&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj-sNCal4neAhVr34MKHWKqA98Q_AUIDigB&biw=1036&bih=583)
      - here are some "spinner" images you could use (show them when the search starts, and hide them when the search ends): http://ajaxloaders.net/2012/10/spinner-loading-animations-set-1/
      



<hr>

<a id="code" />

## IV. Code

1) Code style/standards - [IGME-330 - Course Code Style Requirements](./code-style.md)
    - ES6 modules - multiple distinct code files in a **src** folder - ex. **src/app.js**, **src/favorites.js**, **src/loader.js**, **src/my-component.js**:
      - *each component gets its own JS file*
      - *No JS code is allowed in your HTML file*
        - Instead, use a `<script>` element to load in the JS code you wrote - ex. `<script src="src/app.js" type="module"></script>`
      - your modules will use the [`import`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import) and/or [`export`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/export) keywords as needed
 
2) Ajax
    - Use [`fetch()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API):
      - you may use `.then()` or `await` according to your preference
      - you MUST handle errors with either `.catch()` or `try/catch`
      - *do NOT use `XHR` or `jQuery.ajax()` with this project*

3) `localStorage` - you have already done this in IGME-235 - [9 - WebStorage API](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-230-Master/blob/master/notes/web-apps-9.md)

4) Utilize at least 3 [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components) classes in your project

<a id="media"/>

## V. Media

- HTML Validation
- CSS Validation
- Images optimized:
  - jpeg,gif,png only
  - scaled down to appropriate dimensions for web delivery
  - *for example, a not cropped or scaled 12MP 4032 x 3024 image is too big, and not allowed*
 - Uses the [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) CSS framework

<a id="video"/>

<hr>

## VI. Demo Video

- A 1 to 2-minute narrated “demo reel” of the completed project is required
- Post it to YouTube & put the URL in the dropbox comments field
- If you decide to upload a video file instead, it must be in the MP4 format
- The easiest way to record a demo reel is to use Zoom - here is a 2-minute video on how to do this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D617OXKhSYw
  - another popular option for creating videos is [OBS](https://obsproject.com/download)
  - don't forget to "Share Screen" so that I can see you interacting with the project
  - don't forget to record your narration too, and try to use a better microphone than the one that came with your laptop `:-)`
- Please don't stress out over this requirement - I am the only one who will see the video - I won't be sharing or posting these
- **10% deducted from project 1 grade if this video requirement is not completed**
