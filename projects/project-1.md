## I. Overview

For this project you are creating a JavaScript driven Web application that utilizes one or more Web services.

- The app should serve a purpose - i.e it should be useful to *someone*
- Ideally the experience will run in all modern browsers, but at a bare minimum it must run in recent versions of Chrome.
- The objective of this project is for you to demonstrate your mastery of HTML5/CSS/JS "rich media" programming in a web browser context
- You will be evaluated on:
    - the quality of the experience you create
    - the soundness of your programming
