## I. Overview

For this project you are creating a JavaScript driven Web application that utilizes one or more Web services.

- Your goal is to create an application that does something useful, and is easy to use, functional, and aesthetically pleasing.
- The app should serve a purpose - i.e it should be useful to *someone*
- Ideally the experience will run in all modern browsers, but at a bare minimum it must run in recent versions of Chrome.
- The objective of this project is for you to demonstrate your mastery of HTML5/CSS/JS "rich media" programming in a web browser context
- You will be evaluated on:
    - the quality of the experience you create
    - the soundness of your programming
    - meeting the requirements detailed below
    - how far you went beyond what we did in class, as described below

## IV. Code

1) Code standards:
    - ES6 modules - at least 4 distinct code files - ex. **loader.js**, **main.js**, **utils.js**, **classes.js**:
      - No JS code is allowed in your HTML file
      - Instead, use `<link type="module"
    - declare variables with `const` & `let` only:
      - never use `var`
    - Select DOM elements (aka "DOM Traversal") with `document.querySelector()` and `document.querySelectorAll()`:
      - never use `document.getElementById()`, `document.getElementsByTagName()` wtc, or [jQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - ES6 classes - at least 2 - put them in **classes.js**
 
2) Ajax
    - Use [`fetch()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) and `fetch.then()`
      - do not use [`XHR`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest) or `await fetch(...)` or `jQuery.ajax()` with this project

3) Other prohibited (in addition to what was mentioned above):
    - inline event handlers - ex. `<button onclick="doStuff()">Do Stuff!</button>`
