# Project 2 - *VanillaJS App - now with Maps or Cloud Storage* (DRAFT)

## I. Overview
- This project is a continuation of Project 1, with **at least ONE** of the following additions:
  - An integrated [MapBox](https://www.mapbox.com/) map
    - you would choose this option if your API returns location data
    - The following HW will help you get comfortable with Mapbox:
      - [Mapbox I - Mapbox Intro](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-mapbox-1.md)
      - [Mapbox II - RIT Coffee Finder](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-mapbox-2.md)
      - [Mapbox-III - Virus Map (optional extra credit)](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-mapbox-3.md)
      - Note that the first two HW assignments above are required for EVERYONE even if you choose to use Firebase instead
  - App data stored in the cloud via [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup):
    - you will store some of your app data in "the cloud" (as opposed to localStorage that only stores data locally)
    - what kind of data to store? Maybe search terms for all users, "favorited" or highest rated links or images or Pokemon, etc...
    - The following HW will help you get comfortable with Firebase:
      - [1 - Intro to Firebase - the Realtime Database](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/firebase-1.md)
      - [2 - Firebase Highscore App](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/firebase-2.md)
      - [3 - Firebase Highscore Viewer](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/firebase-3.md)
      - [4 - Firebase "Draw & Share" App (optional extra credit)](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/firebase-4.md)
      - Note that the first two HW assignments above are required for EVERYONE even if you choose to use Mapbox instead

## II. Requirements
- ALL of the Project 1 requirements are still in effect. If you did not meet them the first time around, here is your chance to get them done:
  - [Project 1](project-1.md)
  - [Course Code Style Requirements](code-style.md)
- Be sure to incorporate your Prof's Project 1 feedback into Project 2:
  - You may not yet have a firm grade on that Project, but you should have received feebdback about any obvious changes that were needed. If not, contact your prof.
- One of the Project 1 requirements for the App page, III-B - #2 - *On the app page, you will automatically save the last term searched by the user and other UI *state* in the browser's local storage*, was deferred to this project. Don't forget to complete this requirement.
- You must add MapBox OR Firebase capability to your project (you can add both if you wish)

<hr>

## III. Rubric

- Same as Project 1, with 30% of the overall Project 2 grade being determined by the integration of Mapbox or Firebase into this project

<hr>

## IV. Get Started
- Make a copy of your **project-1** folder (or whatever you called it) and name it **project-2**
- IMPORTANT: Do not delete or modify the files in your **project-1** folder on banjo - leave it be - we need to see what changes you make between Project 1 and Project 2
- Post to the "Project 2 Changes" discussion thread before it closes:
  - tell us whether you are going to utilize Mapbox or Firebase
  - tell us what features you will implement with the above API
