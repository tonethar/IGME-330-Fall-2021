# Project 2 - *VanillaJS App of Awesomeness - now with Maps or Cloud Storage* (DRAFT)

## I. Overview
- This project is a continuation of Project 1, with **at least ONE** of the following additions:
  - An integrated [MapBox](https://www.mapbox.com/) map
    - you would choose this option if your API returns location data
    - The following HW will help you get comfortable with MapBox:
      - [Mapbox I - Mapbox Intro](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-mapbox-1.md)
      - [Mapbox II - RIT Coffee Finder](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-mapbox-2.md)
      - [Mapbox-III - Virus Map (optional extra credit)](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-mapbox-3.md)
      - Note that the first two HW assignments above are required for EVERYONE even if you choose to use Firebase instead
  - App data stored in the cloud via [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup):
    - you will store some of your app data in "the cloud" (as opposed to localStorage that only stores data locally)
    - what kind of data to store? Maybe search terms for all users, "favorited" or highest rated links or images or Pokemon, etc...

## II. Requirements
- You must add MapBox OR Firebase capability to your project (you can add both if you wish)
