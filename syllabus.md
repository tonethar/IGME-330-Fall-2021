## V. Attendance
Attendance is mandatory and you are expected to be on time. Lectures will start promptly at the beginning of class, and will be followed by an in-class assignment or exercise that you are expected to work on until the end of the meeting (i.e. no leaving early).

<hr>

## VI. Grading
Final course grades are determined using the following scale: 

| Class Average | Grade |
| ------------- | ----- |
| 90+%	| A |
| 80+%	| B |
| 70+%	| C |
| 65+%	| D |
| <65%	| F |

### Projects (55%)
* Project 1  - [Interactive Sandbox](projects/project-1.md)
* Project 2  - [MVVM Web Application](projects/project-2.md)

### Homework (22%)
Completing the HW and in-class exercises is essential to learning the course material. You can expect an average of one HW assignment (or "Check off", see below) per class meeting. Keep an eye on the mycourses dropboxes for the dues dates of these assignments. **Important!** - When you submit web file(s) (HTML,CSS,JavaScript) to mycourses dropboxes, they (or the folder they are contained in) must be zipped. If you do not do so, mycourses will strip out all of the CSS and JavaScript, and leave you with a non-functioning and ugly web page. Unzipped assignments will therefore usually receive a grade of zero.

### Check Offs (12%)
"Check offs" are required checkpoints or smaller HW assignments:

### Zoom Attendance/Participation (11%)
1 absence = no penalty, 2 = -2%, 3 = -5%, 4 = -10%, 5+ = additional -5% per absence (Yes, at 5+ absences that's a *negative* grade that reduces your overall grade even further. myCourses is able to calculate that). You can request to be excused from a class meeting, write us in advance of the meeting. If you can't attend class for any reason, always let us know *in advance*.

### Policy on Incomplete Grades
Incomplete grades will be given only in the most exceptional circumstances, soley for issues that arise AFTER the 'W' deadline has passed, and then only by prior arrangement with the professor. Being overcommitted, overwhelmed, and/or not having enough time to complete your coursework is not sufficient justification for an "I". Instead, meet with the professor as early as possible in the semester if you're having difficulty. 

### Academic Dishonesty
- The course policy on academic dishonesty is simple: If you get caught cheating or plagiarizing or commiting duplicate submission without permission, you get an "F" as a grade for the course, a letter detailing the incident goes into your records folder, and you are immediately removed from the class. (If this is a second occurrence during your career at RIT, the penalties are harsher.) Please review RIT's policy on academic dishonesty: 
[http://www.rit.edu/~w-policy/sectionD/D8.html](http://www.rit.edu/~w-policy/sectionD/D8.html)
- **Duplicate submission** is the submitting of the same or similar work for credit in more than one course without prior approval of the instructors for those same courses. *If you took IGME-330 previously, you **may not hand** in code that you previously submitted (for example, a previous version Project 1 Audio Visualizer)*

## VII. Important RIT Deadlines
- Note the deadlines for Add/Drop & "W" here: https://www.rit.edu/calendar
- You have one semester after the class has ended to challenge your grade.

## VIII. Notices of Accommodation
If you have a "Notice of Accommodation", I should have received a copy electronically. Please discuss this with me after class or during my office hours, so that I can make sure all of your accommodations are met.
